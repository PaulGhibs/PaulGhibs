- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @PaulGhibs

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of languages like Html, CSS, PHP, MYSQL, SWIFT, C# , UNITY, UNREAL ENGINE.
As a Growth Engineer from my previous work i also have a bit of basics in Python for webscrapping.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to be certified on some french swift courses recognized by our Government as a diploma of engineering. 
But i'm working on swift since aproximately 2014, first of all by following some courses from https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/.
